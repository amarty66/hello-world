Beside my main project in http://epsilonwiki.free.fr/alphawiki_2/, I'm testing some contributions to Github. 

1) FOO: Nested S-expressions can be evaluated in a single loop working on a single regular expression and a dictionary of primitive functions. As a first minimal example, FOO is written in 20 lines of plain javascript code and comes with a reduced set of 5 primitives, [+ - * / sqrt], a kind of small pocket calculator. Test it in http://epsilonwiki.free.fr/alphawiki_2/?view=foo or in your computer with foo.html and foo.js.

2) FOO_2: Beyond the 20 lines of FOO, this is FOO<sup>2</sup> with about 200 lines of plain javascript code, coming with 14 primitives [lib eval apply = < + - * / sqrt equal? cons car cdr] and 3 special forms [def lambda if]. Test it in http://epsilonwiki.free.fr/alphawiki_2/?view=foo_2 or in your computer with foo_2.html and foo_2.js
